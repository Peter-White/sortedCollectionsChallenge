# sortedCollectionsChallenge
In this console app the user can:

- login in as an employee of the company (if they know the password)
- CRUD items to a stock list
- add items to a basket only if the items are in stock
- remove items from said basket
- checkout; this will get the customer their sum total and deplete form the item stock

This is being built with the intention of adding a gui interface later.
